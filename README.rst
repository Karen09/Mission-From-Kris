Here is Mission from Kris
=========================

Kris-(Your mission, if you choose to accept it,is to build a set of  puppetized
vagrant boxen which deploy Rundeck on one node.   Then create a runbook on
Rundeck which restart a simple service (sshd) on the other node.)



So first I must learn  to make commands with Rundeck to restart sshd,
then use Vagrant to make many of Rundeck machines.  In the end I must
puppetize(with Puppet) Vagrant to make, in one time, hundred of thousand of
Rundeck commands So puppetizing  is automatisation for Vagrant to make
everything easy and at once .
