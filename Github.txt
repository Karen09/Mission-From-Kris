#first i see an video in youtube about github you can see below a link to github beginners video

# http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4

#then i read little bit about how to use it in github.com

#so first you must install Git to your machine,open command(terminal) 

#
Debian/Ubuntu
$ apt-get install git
Fedora
$ yum install git
Gentoo
$ emerge --ask --verbose dev-vcs/git
Arch Linux
$ pacman -S git
openSUSE
$ zypper install git
FreeBSD
$ cd /usr/ports/devel/git
$ make install
Solaris 11 Express
$ pkg install developer/versioning/git
OpenBSD
$ pkg_add git 

#then if it is good luck? got to github.com make an account for inlogging

# Hier we start to add file`s to you git hub account 

# in web page github.com make new repositorie

# en then open your command(terminal)

#
touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/Reposit.git
git push -u origin master

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Reposti.git
git push -u origin master

# then click to refresh in web page,

#                      part 2  genereting SSH key

$ ls -al ~/.ssh
#lists the files in your.ssh directory,if they exist

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key using the provided email
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
# Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home_path/.ssh/id_rsa):

Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase.

Tip: We strongly recommend a very good, secure passphrase. For more information, see Working with SSH key passphrases.

# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

Which should give you something like this:

# Your identification has been saved in /your_home_path/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /your_home_path/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# Agent pid 59566
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa



# Open the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file with a text editor. This is your SSH key.
  Select all and copy to your clipboard.


# Account settings buttonIn the user bar in the top-right corner of any page,
 click setting`s .
 SSH Keys menuClick SSH Keys in the left sidebar.
 SSH Key buttonClick Add SSH key.
 Click Add key.

#To make sure everything is working, you'll now try SSHing to GitHub.

$ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to github


#            Part 3 Changing a remote's URL

#The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:

    An existing remote name, for example, origin
    A new URL for the remote, for example:
        https://github.com/user/repo2.git if you're updating to use HTTPS
        git@github.com:user/repo2.git if you're updating to use SSH

#Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS
git remote -v

# origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the remote set-url command.

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY2.git

Verify that the remote URL has changed.

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
# origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY2.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY2.git (push)
